# SwitchEmulationLinux

A guide to switch emulation for people on Linux

## Guides

Since all 3 vendors have relatively decent drivers, there's no particular emulator that performs better on each vendor. However, we would personally recommend Ryujinx.

**Why?**

We believe that Ryujinx is much more stable, has more features and performs similarly to yuzu in a lot of cases. There are some exceptions (such as smash ultimate), but they're few and far between. However, we will still let you make the choice.
